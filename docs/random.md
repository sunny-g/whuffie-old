in response to Randy Farmer - Rebooting the Web of Trust:
  - the first problem of ignoring context is a non-problem as one credit is one credit, and people will gift different amounts in different contexts (ELABORATE)

  - the second problem is not a problem as your credits are only worth as much your position in the graph; the people who blog about justin bieber are unlikely to be as connected to you and I as those who blog about software. in fact, the global value of your whuffie is proportional to the popularity of the context from which most of your whuffie comes from, which directly enables the "intelligentsia to rise from the ashes and take their rightful place among the powerful."
  
  - the third problem of reputation being a store value is solved by the fact that your reputation will have more and deeper contexts than what could allow if *all* to be wiped out in a single incident 
  (this doesn't take into consideration my other opinion that money is not a store of value, actual value is a store of value)

  - there can only be a few global currencies, and one like whuffie that allows its issuance and usage to have reputational context can be one of them.
