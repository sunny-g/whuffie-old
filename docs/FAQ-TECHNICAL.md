## How does this relate to the concept of a Web-Of-Trust?

## Why build on the Stellar codebase instead of Bitcoin's (or Ethereum's, etc)?

## How is this different from Bitcoin/Ethereum etc?

## How is this different than Keybase and Onename?
onename:
  onename:
  - registers names on the Bitcoin blockchain but we're using Stellar
  - its easier and more natural to manage a namespace and user-errors that may occur than to let names be held and determined on the blockchain, which can be very unforgiving

  keybase:
  - sending your encrypted key to us is safe since we don't serve the JS from our server and since you can build the app from source
