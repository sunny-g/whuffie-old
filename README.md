[Whuffie]() — the social cryptocurrency
==================================================

What is Whuffie?
----------------
Whuffie is an attempt at creating a money system that truly captures the essence of money: 
> ... in the old days, if you were broke but respected, you wouldn't starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could buy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really represented — your personal capital with your friends and neighbors — you more accurately gauged your success. 

> \- Cory Doctorow, *Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom*

Note: 
-----
Whuffie is currently an ugly, pre-alpha WIP to be seen and used by no one.
