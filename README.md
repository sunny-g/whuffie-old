Contribution Guides
--------------------------------------

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](http://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](http://contribute.jquery.org/code/)


Environments in which to use jQuery
--------------------------------------

- [Browser support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/) differs between the master branch and the compat branch. Specifically, the master branch does not support legacy browsers such as IE8. The jQuery team continues to provide support for legacy browsers on the compat branch. Use the latest compat release if support for those browsers is required. See [browser support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/) for more info.
- To use jQuery in Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments, use only master branch releases given the name "jquery" rather than "jquery-compat". The compat branch does not support these environments.

What is Whuffie?
----------------
Whuffie is an attempt at creating a money system that truly captures the essence of money: 
> ... in the old days, if you were broke but respected, you wouldn't starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could buy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really represented — your personal capital with your friends and neighbors — you more accurately gauged your success. 

> \- Cory Doctorow, *Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom*

Note: 
-----
Whuffie is currently an ugly, pre-alpha WIP to be seen and used by no one.
