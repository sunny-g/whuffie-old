/*
stored in "credential" array in the user's Identity JSON-LD

notes:
  - creating the gist is proof of github ownership
  - signing it with the stellar key is
    - proof of that stellar key ownership
    - proof of association between the two

questions/attacks
  ** ask what services/attacks you want to provide/prevent, not what are all possible **

  - machine pulls JSON-LD, wants to verify credentials
    - pull the gist, pull the json-ld
    - check that the claims are identical
    - check that the signature (from jsonld) against the claim and pubKey

  âˆš user's Github gets hacked, hacker changes the gist
    - the hacker can't forge your signature
    - the gist and JSON-LD credential become invalid

  - you want to verify a user's identity from the gist
    * you can't, you still need to go back to the id of the user, then verify the claim
